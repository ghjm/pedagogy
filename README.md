This is a repo to contain various materials Graham uses in training sessions.

### Conventions in instructions in this repo:

* `ls -l` is a thing you type
* `ls -l<Enter>` special keys are named inside angle brackets, so this means you hit the Enter key, not literally type `<` `E` `n` `t` `e` `r` `>`
* `ls -l [homedir]` words in square brackets are to be replaced with some value mentioned in an earlier step, so in this case, you might actually type something like `ls -l /home`
* "Run `command`" means to run the command from a bash prompt, followed by `<Enter>`.
* "Type `foo<Enter>`" means to type the characters as given.  If an `<Enter>` is necessary, it will be given explicitly.
* "Hit `i`" means to type one single keystroke.
